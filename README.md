# Admin Dashboard

This is the final project of the Intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project curriculum. It focuses on more advanced techniques and concepts on those languages, mainly the use of CSS grid, as well as other tricks I learned along the way.

It is a static admin dashboard design. This site is not funcional, nor is it too responsive or compatible with mobile devices, but it does showcase my general abilites on CSS, which I previously very much disliked working with. I can't say creating it was easy, but I am definitively improving on my front-end development skills, and I didn't find it too challenging compared to my first projects.

As always, I focused one section at a time to complete this website. Starting with the navigation bar, followed by the header, and finally the main content cards (which were the toughest to complete). I followed the design presented in the curriculum, but not too closely this time. I tried to make it as responsive as possible, but as it is not the focus of this project, I didn't worry too much about it.

 Overall, a very nice learning experience, and a great challenge to develop my CSS and HTML skills, as there were many concepts for me to learn and absorb while developing it.
